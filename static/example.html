		I'm convinced that neither U.S. political party wants to fix this problem. The Republicans want to be the defenders of the Second Amendment, although its interpretation has changed so much over the years that it isn't even recognizable. The Democrats want to deal with the symptoms and not the cause.

One of the big problems that the MIT/IBM team is overcoming is the AI's ability to do causal analysis. One of the big problems we currently have in decision making with and without AIs is that correlation tends to drive decisions, but correlation doesn't pinpoint causes. There is a massive correlation between mass shootings and guns, but there is virtually no evidence that guns are the cause of mass killings. They are the preferred tool in the U.S., but in other countries, other things are far more effective and available.

The example IBM used was one of margarine and divorce rates. While the graphs mirror each other over time, there has been no evidence of any connection, let alone causation.

The reason we should focus on the cause rather than the tool is that there are mass killings in areas of low gun use, and the people who commit them use alternatives like bombs, knives and cars to accomplish their goals. Explosives can result in a far higher death count and a far higher count of both critically injured and disabled people than an attack by a gun.

So, using worldwide data, we should be able to analyze whether getting rid of guns would result in fewer deaths, and whether there might be more easily accomplished alternatives that would massively reduce this problem. One possibility might be reaching an agreement with the NRA to curtail opposition to gun ownership in exchange for its agreement to stop blocking weapon safety advancements, to support better mandatory gun safety training, and to back a much more aggressive policy with respect to diagnosed mental illness, which would apply to all sellers.

On their current path, the NRA is going to be instrumental in getting the U.S. Second Amendment repealed or massively amended because, increasingly, it has been positioning itself directly on the critical path to preventing children from being shot.

The CDC could do the work to analyze what is likely a rich set of causes, but the Republicans have been blocking the effort, fearing the result obviously would be fewer guns. (By the way, given the CDC is independent, this would suggest it also believes it is on the wrong side of this.) However, the Democrats could fund this research, which would focus both on identifying the biggest causes and identifying practices that would lower the potential for mass killings.

I'm not a fan of the death penalty solution, because it appears that most mass shooters are prepared to die, and many do die in the process of carrying out their attacks. A more practical approach might be to allow a path to the death they seem to want without the interim step of killing a lot of kids. That would have to flow out of the research and modeling, however. In the end, much like IBM showcased with AI development, if you want to fix a problem, you need to do causal analysis.

If you don't focus on the cause and limit yourself to examining the symptoms, just as in treating a disease, you have a high probability of making the actual problem worse. In carrying out the biggest domestic terrorist attack in the U.S., the attacker used fertilizer, not guns. Given the linked PBS program seems to suggest we have another of these coming, we don't have a lot of time to identify and eliminate the likely causes for this scale of the attack.
